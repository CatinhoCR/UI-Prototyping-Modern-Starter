## Dependencies

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and `NPM`.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started).
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start).
- [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/).

**Note:** Yarn may be replaced and not used in case that's what you want. Yarn's installation times and version tree control for dependencies is cool though. If you decide not to use yarn, simply delete the yarn.lock file and instead of running yarn, run npm.

## Installation

```bash
git clone --depth=1 --branch=master git@github.com:CatinhoCR/UI-Prototyping-Modern-Starter.git YourProjectFolder && rm -rf YourProjectFolder/.git
```

This will clone the repository, without it's history so you can kickoff your project clean. It also deletes the git's folder so you can use your own repository for your templating. So you can do these 2 next, for initializing a new git repository and adding your own remote.

```bash
git init && git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
```

After you have all the needed dependencies installed in your machine, simply navigate to the project's root folder in your terminal and run:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Usage

```bash
